          <h2>Experience Overiew</h2>
          <p>Herff Jones was my first introduction to the design profession and gave me ample opportunities to apply what Iwas learning during my BFA program at Utah State University. I was able to use the design process to create yearbook covers, page layouts, identity systems and digital presentations for students all over the nation. I also developed communication and customer service skills as I worked directly with school through design workshops and virtual design sessions.</p>

          <h2>2008&ndash;2012 Yearbook Design</h2>
          <p>Yearbooks are an important rite of passage for youth and a valuable tool in capturing our personal histories. My role as a creative illustrator and designer was to capture themes from the year through popular culture and significant school memories and present them through print design. These samples reflex thousands of hours of time spent in design tools.</p>

          <h2>2010&ndash;2012 Art Department Annual Digital Presentations</h2>
          <p>Each year our department would produce a digital portfolio of our favorite projects and share them to our sales reps and schools to help them get ideas and inspiration for their next project. My role for these was to design and develop these presentations, which represent some of my earliest experiences with front-end code.</p>
