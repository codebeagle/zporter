            <h2>Core Values</h2>
            <p>I have spent much of my life learning first hand the values of hard work and integrity. I grew up with the Scouting program and learned invaluable lessons in leadership and self-development which has helped me become a top acheiver in many areas of my life. I strive for personal growth, authenticity, and helping those in need.</p>
            <p>I believe in doing the right thing and leaving things better than I found them. I believe design can be used to help make life better for everyone and solve some of the biggest issues facing humanity today.</p>
