          <h1>About</h1> 
          <p>Thanks for taking a few minutes to learn more about me. I am a designer, developer, adventurer, husband, and dad living in Utah. I have always had an interest in the arts and I studied Graphic Design at Utah State University. Outside of work I enjoy overlanding and camping, learning new skills, and spending time with my family.</p>
          <p>2020 marked ten wonderful years of marriage to my best friend and life support, Nicole. We have two incredibly smart children and together we are working to buy our first home and enjoy life. We like pizza, laughing, and Netflix.</p>
