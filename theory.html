      <h2>Follow the Design Thinking Process</h2>
      <p>Any designer worth their salt will agree that the design process is at the heart of the profession and it’s important to give each step a chance to take place. When working on projects, I do my best to ensure enough time to properly empathize, define the problem or problems, ideate new options, prototype solutions, and test them for efficacy and reiterate again.</p>

      <h2>Tie Goes to the User</h2>
      <p>There are times when some aspects of the experience are at odds with each other and in those instances, I believe you can never go wrong by allowing the user to win. If a business objective conflicts with best interest of a customer or user, I prefer to question the objective and search for new options.</p>

      <h2>Tools != Design</h2>
      <p>I wish I could shout this from the top of the mountains so that all people would understand. Knowledge of a software, tool, or framework does not make you a skilled designer. Tools are a vehicle for visualizing and prototyping the ideas of the designer. The design is effective when the design knows the design process and how to translate their ideas into reality.</p>

      <h2>Big Picture and Small Details</h2>
      <p>Solving complex problems and architecting scalable systems requires an open mind to multiple perspectives. I strive to see the “big picture” from the beginning while paying attention to all the small details that make a design solution exceptional. I care as much about our 10 year goals as the differences between a hyphen, en dash, and em dash. </p>

      <h2>Learn Something New Each Day</h2>
      <p>Experience design is always evolving and changing and it’s important to keep up with what is happening. I continually strive to learn new things and new ways of working through research, reading, self-learning, and other training methods.</p>
